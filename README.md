## Introduction

This project provides a basic implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using only the NumPy library. MLP is a type of feedforward neural network that can be used for various machine learning tasks, such as classification and regression.

## Features

- A flexible and customizable MLP implementation.
- Support for variable input and output dimensions.
- Multiple activation functions, including ReLU and Sigmoid.
- Mini-batch gradient descent for training.
- Example code for training and using the MLP for common tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mlp-repo.git
   cd your-mlp-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train and use the MLP, you can refer to the example notebooks provided in the `examples/` directory. These notebooks demonstrate how to set up and train the MLP for various tasks.

```python
# Example code for creating and training an MLP
from mlp import MLP

# Initialize the MLP
mlp = MLP(input_size=64, hidden_sizes=[128, 64], output_size=10)

# Load your data
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = load_data()

# Train the MLP
mlp.train(X_train, y_train, learning_rate=0.01, num_epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Make predictions
predictions = mlp.predict(X_test)
```

## MLP Architecture

The MLP consists of multiple layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The forward pass and backward pass (backpropagation) are implemented using standard neural network equations:

**Forward Pass:**

\[
\begin{align*}
z^{(l)} &= a^{(l-1)}W^{(l)} + b^{(l)} \\
a^{(l)} &= \sigma(z^{(l)})
\end{align*}
\]

Where:
- \(a^{(l)}\) is the activation of layer \(l\).
- \(W^{(l)}\) and \(b^{(l)}\) are the weight and bias matrices for layer \(l\).
- \(\sigma\) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU or Sigmoid).

**Backward Pass (Gradient Descent):**

\[
\begin{align*}
\delta^{(L)} &= \nabla_a J \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)}) \\
\delta^{(l)} &= \delta^{(l+1)}W^{(l+1)T} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
\end{align*}
\]

Where:
- \(\delta^{(l)}\) is the error in layer \(l\).
- \(J\) is the loss function.
- \(\sigma'\) is the derivative of the activation function.
- \(\nabla_a J\) is the gradient of the loss with respect to the activations.
